## Final Report

The final report should be no more than 8 pages including references and appendices. The report should focus on your process for solving the challenges as well as the highlights of your techniques. The report should also summarize (e.g., table) the correct inputs and any revealed text output/flag for the solved challenges. Final reports should follow the format of a technical paper rather than a tutorial or plain description of how the team solved each challenge. The report is also an opportunity to impress the judges with your approach to the given problems as well as to highlight insights or how the team overcame difficulties in the challenge. You should submit the final report along with your source code via HotCRP.



## Presentation

The powerpoint presentation is limited to ***10 slides***. The presentations must be sent to the organizers via email to **csaw-esc@nyu.edu** by 2 November 2020 at 11:59pm eastern time US. Presentations should follow a standard 4:3 PowerPoint presentation template.



## Video

Each team should prepare a **6 minute** video to be presented to the audience of the virtual finals as well as the judges of the competition; this is your opportunity to impress them! The video should present your team, summarize the challenges you solved and highlight your unique techniques for solving them. You should submit your video using a **private Google Drive link** (make sure that anyone with the link outside your organization should be able to access it without login, but the video must remain private). The deadline for the video is  **October 31, 2020** at 11:59pm eastern time US (this is a firm deadline, as the video must be uploaded to the vFairs virtual event platform on time). You can sent the Google Drive link to the organizers via email to **csaw-esc@nyu.edu**.
